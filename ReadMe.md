# Solar Renewable Token Curated Registry Splash Page 

This decentralized application allows developers to list their solar energy projects on the Solar Renewable Token Curated Registry (TCR). Investors can then invest in clean energy initiatives by voting on the projects they believe should be listed. If the majority of the developers vote to accept a project, it will appear on the list. Conversely, if the TCR community decides to challenge a project's application and the majority votes against it, the project will be rejected, and the deposit will be distributed among participating voters.

## Features

- Register solar energy projects with project details and payments using XUMM Wallet.
- Voting mechanism for developers to accept or reject projects.
- Challenge system for community members to contest project applications.
- Display list of registered projects and leaderboard of top investors.

## Technologies Used

- React for the front-end user interface.
- XRP Ledger for payments and voting.
- Flask for the back-end API.
- SQLite for the database.
- Xaman SDK for connecting to Xaman Wallet.
